Hi! I am Yiran HU (胡伊然). My name derives from an old Chinese Poem. 蒹葭苍苍，白露为霜。所谓伊人，在水一方。(Green, green the reed. Dew and frost gleam. Where’s she I need. Beyond the stream.)

I am now a third year master student at Tsinghua University.  I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Weixing Shen](https://www.law.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1056/1233.htm) and Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/). Additionally, I serve as a research assistant at the University of Hong Kong, working under the guidance of Prof. [Ben Kao](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/kao). My major research interest lies in Computational Law. Pursuing courses in both the Department of Computer Science and the School of Law, and collaborating with students from diverse backgrounds on research, has made my graduate life truly fascinating.

Looking ahead, I aspire to delve into more intriguing research areas within computational social science, such as AI in education and AI in psychology. I am particularly fascinated by the integration of domain knowledge in language models and also passionate about exploring the robustness and safety of AI.

In the upcoming fall of 2024, I am actively seeking a PhD position to further my academic journey.

Projects
======
* ***National Ministry of Science and Technology key research and development project "Private Lending Intelligent Trial Technology", Group Member*** \
  Construct a fact determination system characterized by case labels, a judgment rule system with the focus of disputes as the core, and an automatic recognition algorithm supported by pretrained models. The results of this project include two core business segments: an intelligent trial assistance platform and a similar case retrieval platform; It also includes two major adjudication auxiliary tools: an adjudication rule base and a complex debt interest calculator.Responsible for the training the similiar case retrieval algorithm and developing the retrieval platform with the case label and the focus of controversy as the core. The similiar case retrieval dataset has been accepted in CIKM2023 resource track.
* ***Conversational Legal Case Retrieval, Group Member*** \
  The goal of this project is to construct a conversational legal case retrieval system. By conducting multi-round dialogues between users and experts to identify user needs, the system will perform similar case retrieval tasks based on the user's complete requirements. This project is divided into three parts: user behavior analysis, dataset construction, and pre-training model construction. The user behavior analysis paper has been accepted in ECIR2023, the clarifying question generation model paper has been accepted in CIKM2023.
* ***The Trusted Legal Artificial Intelligence, Group Member*** \
  Using counterfactual methods to explore the robustness of judicial pre-training models in intelligent legal trials. Attacks were carried out on models such as Legal-Bert and Lawformer to determine the basis for the models' judgments and to propose methods to improve the robustness of the models. The project is under study and is expected to be completed in spring 2024.
* ***Work Injury Compensation Tool Series, Group Leader*** \
  The work injury compensation tool series includes a calculator of work injury compensation (Web version, WeiXin mini program version) and a case retrieval platform for work injury compensation. The case retrieval platform is mainly aimed at searching the typical cases of work injuries. As the person in charge of the "Work Injury Compensation Calculator" tool series, I led a team to sort out the work injury insurance regulations and local administrative regulations, and organized the legal provisions into calculation logic, which eventually formed both a web and mini program version. The case retrieval platform mainly focuses on typical work injury cases. We sorted out the labels and annotated the cases, and conducted case searches through label-based retrieval. All calculators and retrieval platforms are now online. [[Access link]](thulawtech.com)
* ***The Legal Aid Platform Construction, Group Leader*** \
  Carry out the program deployment design and requirement document writing for the legal aid platform. The functions of the legal aid platform are divided into four modules: intelligent consultation and service, intelligent distribution, traceability governance, and knowledge community. The initial draft of the requirement document has been completed, and the first phase of the system is expected to be launched in July 2023.
